# Digital-image-processing-codes
These are the codes pertaining to the assignment problems given to us in the course Digital Image Processing

In the first assignment, I have converted colour image to gray shades image, then edited the image by increasing brightness, decreasing brightness, increasing contrast, decreasing contrast. After this I have applied 
histogram equalization to all the 4 edited images. Then I have plotted the histograms.

In the second assignment, I have found the fourier transform of the image and plotted it. Superimposed circles w.r.t full size spectrum image and calculated image power encircled by these circles. Then I have applied 
the inverse fourier transform and reconstructed the image
